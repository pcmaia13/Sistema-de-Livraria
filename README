Exercise: Library Control System
You have been hired to develop a library control system in JavaScript. The system must allow registering books, checking available books, borrowing and returning books. Create a program that meets these requirements.

Requirements:
Book Registration:

Create a function to register a book in the system. Each book must have a title, author, year of publication and status (available or on loan).
Book Consultation:

Implement a function that lists all registered books, indicating the status of each one (available or borrowed).
Book Lending:

Create a function that allows you to borrow a book. The user must enter the title of the desired book. If the book is available, its status should be changed to borrowed. Otherwise, display a message that the book is not available.
Book Returns:

Implement a function to return a book. The user must inform the title of the book to be returned. If the book is on loan, its status should be changed to available. Otherwise, display a message stating that the book is not on loan.
Main menu:

Create a main menu that allows the user to choose between registration, consultation, loan, return or exiting the system options. Use a control structure to direct program flow based on user choice.
Comments:
Use objects to represent the books and an array to store all registered books.
Consider using functions to organize your code.
Implement error handling for situations such as attempting to borrow/return a non-existent book.
The program must continue running until the user chooses the exit option.
This is a practical task that involves applying concepts of control structures, functions and object manipulation in JavaScript.
